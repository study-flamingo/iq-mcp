# IQ-MCP Project Instructions

## STOP - READ THIS FIRST

**BEFORE writing ANY code that interacts with a dependency:**

1. **CHECK THE LIBRARY DOCS** - Use Context7, WebFetch, or WebSearch
2. **SEARCH FOR EXISTING SOLUTIONS** - `from library.module import ...`
3. **ASK if unsure** - "Does [library] provide a built-in way to do X?"

**DO NOT create custom implementations when the library provides the functionality.**

This project uses **FastMCP** - it has built-in providers for OAuth, authentication, etc.
